Use websearch. as a css professional, find out exactly what people use to cause the frosted glass effect via tailwindcss. youve combined opacity params, alpha values and background blur and what not and built a very complicated system in vanilla css. look at how to simply make the frosted glass simply using let's say backdrop-blur-md(in vanilla css) or other simple settings. current css is overcomplicated. simplify it. i guess due to such overcomplication, the glass frost doesnt appear. i have to retype backdrop blur value in the ide to make it take effect after recompilation of css occurs due to retyping. but this shouldnt happen. its happening cuz i think the css has lots of things fighting for the looks, opacity, transparency and blur. since now we have tailwind support, port the entire css styling to tailwind for the whole UI, not just glass. stop using native css. have a fresh makeup of the website to a polished look by entirely revamped styling. though note thhat current UI shapes and layouts were made logically using ratio/propoertions and very less hardcoding was done. this way, the exact look of component shapes and placements was achieved. maintain this shapes, placements and sizings in the ported look as well via logical, non hardcoded codes.ultrathink and do the style porting with a well thought out logic and plan without using overcomplicated things. ensure to look up on the internet about exactly how to use tailwind for this effect and how dark and light modes are handled via tailwind. do smart, well thought out, and logically planned porting that ensures the frosted glass look is achieved and we use tailwind instead of native css. use tailwindcss and tw-animate-css now onwards. got it?
Hence, build up the css styling from a fresh canvas in a way so that future additions can be well integrated and no overcomplication or conflicting styles occur.
