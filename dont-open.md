horrible. not at all how i imagined. the ui_v1.png shows the ui currently. this completely contrasts with the one i imagined in the mockup. look at the mockup in detail. these are pointers: 1)all elements arent centre aligned. 2) heyy, im divyansh and the ai porfolio heading are inside rectangular components? WHYYYYYYY. 3) why is the current ui showing the avatar in a bubble? was that shown in the mockup image? 4) why is canvas effect a layer above the components? it should sit below all the components. that was said so that frosted glass effect would look good showing the undergoing ripples of the fluid in a blurred frosted glass way. that was the vision. 5) the avatar png is supposed to be snuggly places right above the text box. | comment: very very disappointed in you. look at the mockup image again and ensure you logically follow one part by one part's design to be exactly as envisioned. dont spit out bullshit like this. use ultrathinking, break down the entire thing i want into atomic tasks and work on finishing and making the UI i wanted.

you were cut off. you were working on the current portfolio website of mine.the inspiration comes from the mockup1.png. theres a white themed light grid background on which a fluid sim is done that is interactive and colorful. these 2 tasks were completed well. but then, i 
  gave you the mockup1.png image to replicate. idea was to have the chat box and the 5 preset box components and the top part D shaped logo with "frosted flass" like components. the text of hey im divyansh and the heading ai portfolio was to just be there centred on the page 
  below the small D shaped logo component. then after some vertical spoace the avatar image of mine would be shown attached snugging right above the ask me anything typing frosted glass component. but you made utter bullshit. nothing was having frosted glass look. everything 
  had rectangualr glass component divs i guess. not at all how i imagined. these were my comments to you exactly: "horrible. not at all how i imagined. the ui_v1.png shows the ui currently. this completely contrasts with the one i imagined in the mockup. look at the mockup in
   detail. these are pointers: 1)all elements arent centre aligned. 2) heyy, im divyansh and the ai porfolio heading are inside rectangular components? WHYYYYYYY. 3) why is the current ui showing the avatar in a bubble? was that shown in the mockup image? 4) why is canvas 
  effect a layer above the components? it should sit below all the components. that was said so that frosted glass effect would look good showing the undergoing ripples of the fluid in a blurred frosted glass way. that was the vision. 5) the avatar png is supposed to be 
  snuggly places right above the text box. | comment: very very disappointed in you. look at the mockup image again and ensure you logically follow one part by one part's design to be exactly as envisioned. dont spit out bullshit like this. use ultrathinking, break down the

  your current ui, eventhough does centre things up, doesnt quite do it correctly. look at ui_v2.png to see current ui image. then compare it with mockup1.png. 1)the avatar isnt snuggly edge to edge sitting right on the top edge of the ask me anything component. 2) the         │
│   component of ask me anything isnt pill shaped but rather a round corner rectangle, which isnt what was there in the mockup. 3) the 5 buttons present are too distant and at the page's bottom. they are to be just a bit below the ask me anything box. also the logo, the header 


ok now for wheneve a question is typed and asked, we will showcase text response as its doing right now. the preset quick questions when asked though, will lead to sending the preset question from user side. then the log and thinking animation will come but it wont be followed by a simple response chat message. it will be followed by separate UI showcases within the glass chat modal for each of the 5 quick questions. so, let the loading then chat bubble stay for whenever a question is typed. i will later connect an instruction-tuned ai chatbot to that. for the 5 buttons though, i wanna build different ways to showcase things and projects intuitively in the chat interface. i will describe them one by one and we will build those. you ready?
