I love taking part in AI hackathons and have this experience:
1. InterIIT 2024 Gold Medal(National):
    - RELEVANCE_SCORE: 10/10
    - Work done:
        - Researched and engineered a dynamic, self-adaptive multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the Pathway framework, specifically tailored for complex queries in the legal and finance domains.
        - Implemented advanced retrieval methodologies like Meta Data Filtering and Contextual Preprocessing to improve the contextual relevance and accuracy of retrieved information. Additional user-centric features such as "Chat with PDF", "Human in the loop" for query clarification, and a persistent "Chat Memory" system using MongoDB were also developed.
        - Architected a dual-framework system that includes a DAG-based LLM Compiler and the dynamically orchestrated agentic Moray execution mode, with a router agent to dynamically select the appropriate framework based on query complexity.
        - Moray Framework Deep Dive: As the lead on this component, I designed and built Swormy to handle highly sophisticated and complex queries.
            - Planning: It utilizes a Tree-of-Thought (ToT) planning system that generates multiple 'thoughts' or potential analysis paths. These paths are branched and evaluated simultaneously using an internal scoring system that prunes invalid or inefficient routes, optimizing for resource allocation and solution accuracy. This self-critiquing capability removes the need for a separate pre-planner.
            - Execution: Moray employs a dynamic agent orchestration system that assembles a tailored team of general and specialist agents to solve the query. Its asynchronous execution framework allows for the parallel processing of each agent's tasks, significantly reducing latency and enabling robust error handling where agents can re-select tools upon failure.
            - Synthesis & Analytics: A dedicated Compiler Agent analyzes all outputs from the agent team to generate a detailed, coherent final response. It can also identify plottable data and pass it to charting tools for visualization. The framework includes an analytics system to track token usage, execution time, and resource utilization for performance evaluation and optimization.
    - Impact:
        - Achieved a state-of-the-art (Dec'24) word overlap score of 0.94 in retrieval tasks, demonstrating superior contextual accuracy over existing methods.
        - The system automated complex, multi-step tasks, reducing manual effort by up to 95%. For example, it cut a 2-week financial statement analysis task down to 12 minutes and a 1-3 day legal compliance check to approximately 10 minutes.
        - Demonstrated high versatility across a range of use cases, including Equity Report generation, automated Contract Compliance checks, and Legal Case Retrieval.
    - Tech stack:  Pathway, LangGraph, Python, Stella-1.5B (Embeddings), Claude API, GPT API, BM25, USearchKNN, MongoDB, APIs (Yahoo Finance, Polygon, SerpAPI), etc.

      - Level 1 (Resume Scoring): Implemented an automated resume screening module using NLP to extract and quantify key features like years of experience, education level, and skill count. Calculated a Job Match Score using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity against job descriptions.
      - Level 2 (Network Analysis): Constructed a directed recommendation graph where nodes represent candidates and recommenders. Developed a Credibility Score using a weighted formula that incorporates key graph metrics: PageRank (to measure influence), Inverse Betweenness Centrality (to identify credible but less-connected candidates), In-Degree (recommendation volume), and a Reciprocity penalty (to flag circular endorsements).
      - Level 3 (Recommendation Validation): Engineered a skill-matching system that extracts skills from resumes (using regex) and recommendation letters (using Skilner). It then performs pairwise semantic comparison using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model to generate a final similarity score, validating the authenticity of endorsements.
    - Impact:
      - Created a system that significantly enhances hiring efficiency and reliability by automating screening, validating recommendations, and flagging potential fraud.

      - Developed a high-performance, dual-task solution for academic paper analysis.
      - Task 1 (Publishability Assessment): Created "TACC," an innovative dual-LLM reasoning system featuring an Actor-Critic architecture. The Actor LLM operates as a reasoning engine, building a multi-branching Tree of Thoughts (ToT) to explore diverse evaluation perspectives. The Critic LLM acts as an intelligent pruning mechanism, using a Contrastive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methodology to systematically compare and select the most robust reasoning path for a final binary decision.
      - Task 2 (Conference Recommendation): Engineered "SCRIBE," a sophisticated ensemble model that makes recommendations via a reasoning-based vote. It combines the outputs of three parallel systems: (1) a "Cookbook"-augmented LLM for rule-based classification , (2) a hybrid RAG system using
      - BM25 and vector search for similarity matching , and (3) the "SCHOLAR" agent, which dynamically generates queries for the 
      - Semantic Scholar API to search across 190M papers.
    - Impact:
      - Achieved state-of-the-art results in publication assessment, with 100% accuracy on reference data and 92% accuracy on a larger combined dataset.
      - The conference recommendation system attained 90% overall accuracy and a 90.5% macro-average F1-score, automating a highly complex and time-consuming task for researchers.
